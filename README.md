**üëã Hello, this addon adds a big pack of new actions and placeholders to ConditionalEvents, with it you have full control over entities, players, storages and many other useful features: everything that was previously possible only through vanilla commands or not possible at all in ConditionalEvents, is now possible directly in the built-in actions or placeholders.**


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation:
1. Install the TriggerReactor plugin at https://github.com/TriggerReactor/TriggerReactor/releases/download/3.5.0.6-Beta/TriggerReactor-bukkit-latest-3.5.0.6-Beta.jar.
2. Install the TriggerReactor dependency at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/jshader.93342/download?version=406835.
3. Download the archive in the newest version folder at the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uSHXs5Y6o07R6dODUe2fONvl0bYaQrLq?usp=sharing (archive only) OR download all source content here on GitHub.
4. Unpack the contents of the archive into the plugins folder (as a result, the plugins folder should contain the TriggerReactor folder with all its contents, and if the folder was already there, replace it).
5. Restart the server
6. Make sure that everything is installed without errors: in the console you should see messages from ConditionalEvents and PlaceholderAPI about successful registration of new actions and new extension respectively.

## üîß Modification:
For advanced users there is a great opportunity to modify everything instantly and easily: all data is stored in the path ``plugins/TriggerReactor/Executor``, ``CEPlaceholdersActivator`` activates the registration of placeholders and ``CEActionsActivator`` activates the registration of actions, all placeholders are in the same file and all actions are in different files which are signed accordingly. If you want to replace something in an action or placeholder, just change the necessary files in the desired location and reload the server. Adding new actions and placeholders is also quite simple: for a new action, just create a new file in this folder and name it so that it starts with ``CE``, does not contain ``Activator`` and has the extension ``.js``; in case of new placeholders, add them in the file ``CEPlaceholdersActivator``, and after all the changes, also restart the server.
