**üëã Hello, this addon adds a big pack of new actions and placeholders to ConditionalEvents, with it you have full control over entities, players, storages and many other useful features: everything that was previously possible only through vanilla commands or not possible at all in ConditionalEvents, is now possible directly in the built-in actions or placeholders.**

### The main goal of the addon is to provide as much functionality as possible in addition to the existing one, quality tries not to be inferior to quantity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation [here](https://optifynes-organization.gitbook.io/ce-aapp/ce-aapp/installation-or-updation#installation).

## üîß Modification:
For advanced users there is a great opportunity to modify everything instantly and easily: all data is stored in the path ``plugins/TriggerReactor/Executor``, ``CEPlaceholdersActivator`` activates the registration of placeholders and ``CEActionsActivator`` activates the registration of actions, all placeholders are in the same file and all actions are in different files which are named accordingly. If you want to replace something in an action or placeholder, just change the necessary files in the desired location and reload the server. Adding new actions and placeholders is also quite simple: for a new action, just create a new file in this folder and name it so that it starts with ``CE``, does not contain ``Activator`` and has the extension ``.js``; in case of new placeholders, add them in the file ``CEPlaceholdersActivator``, and after all the changes, also restart the server.

## üìå Information ([CE AAPP DOCS](https://optifynes-organization.gitbook.io/ce-aapp/)):
### Currently the addon has 49 new actions and 17 new placeholders with different subplaceholders.
